This is a 2-D game that I created only using Java
Designed and created a 2-D Block Game using java to improve the reaction time of my client. The player would
control a block and catch falling apples from a tree while avoiding falling rocks to earn points. Getting hit by a
rock would lower the health and every 30 seconds the speed of the falling rocks would increase. The game ends
when health reaches 0.
